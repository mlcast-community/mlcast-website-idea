              We're building an <span className="text-foreground font-semibold">open-source community</span> dedicated 
              to advancing machine learning for weather nowcasting through collaborative development and shared resources.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Our collective gives institutes with GPU access the opportunity to train models, while those with 
              limited resources can contribute to development, testing, and ultimately benefit from using these models.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Through equal ownership and transparent collaboration, we're creating a unified Python package that 
              makes state-of-the-art nowcasting accessible to everyone.
